# TicTacToe

This was one of my first side projects, a simple two player TicTacToe game in Racket.
Mouse & Keyboard Interactive.
Keyboard Instructions: Use 'up', 'left', 'right', and 'down' arrow keys to move the cursor and use spacebar to insert your piece.
Mouse Instructions: Each box is clickable, use 'mouse1' to insert your piece.
Player 0: O piece, goes first.
Player 1: X piece, goes second.
